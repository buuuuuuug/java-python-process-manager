# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a Java-based process management system that can create, monitor, and communicate with Python processes. The system provides comprehensive lifecycle management including process health monitoring, metrics collection, log aggregation, and inter-process communication. A Python bootstrap script serves as the entry point for all Python executions, handling resource management and process initialization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Java application developer, I want to execute Python scripts through ProcessBuilder, so that I can integrate Python functionality into my Java application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python script execution is requested THEN the system SHALL create a new Python process using Java ProcessBuilder
2. WHEN creating a Python process THEN the system SHALL use pythonBootstrap.py as the entry point
3. WHEN the Python process is created THEN the system SHALL capture the process handle for lifecycle management
4. IF the Python executable is not found THEN the system SHALL throw a clear exception with diagnostic information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive process lifecycle management, so that I can monitor and control Python processes effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python process is running THEN the system SHALL continuously monitor process health status
2. WHEN checking process health THEN the system SHALL determine if the process is alive, dead, or unresponsive
3. WHEN a process becomes unresponsive THEN the system SHALL provide mechanisms to forcefully terminate it
4. WHEN a process terminates THEN the system SHALL capture and report the exit code
5. WHEN monitoring processes THEN the system SHALL collect CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution time metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time log collection from Python processes, so that I can debug and monitor Python script execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python process generates log output THEN the system SHALL capture both stdout and stderr streams
2. WHEN log data is captured THEN the system SHALL forward it to the Java application's logging system
3. WHEN processing logs THEN the system SHALL preserve log timestamps and severity levels
4. WHEN log streams are full THEN the system SHALL handle backpressure without blocking the Python process
5. WHEN a Python process terminates THEN the system SHALL ensure all remaining log data is collected

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want bidirectional communication between Java and Python processes, so that I can exchange data and control commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN communication is needed THEN the system SHALL establish a reliable data channel between Java and Python
2. WHEN sending data to Python THEN the system SHALL serialize data in a format both processes can understand
3. WHEN receiving data from Python THEN the system SHALL deserialize and validate the received data
4. WHEN communication fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and eventually timeout
5. WHEN the communication channel is closed THEN both processes SHALL handle the disconnection gracefully

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Python script developer, I want a bootstrap script that handles process initialization, so that my Python scripts run in a controlled environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pythonBootstrap.py starts THEN it SHALL configure resource limits for the Python process
2. WHEN initializing THEN the bootstrap SHALL set up proper logging configuration and handlers
3. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the bootstrap SHALL terminate the process gracefully
4. WHEN the target Python script is specified THEN the bootstrap SHALL dynamically load and execute it
5. WHEN the target script completes THEN the bootstrap SHALL perform cleanup and report execution status
6. WHEN an error occurs during script loading THEN the bootstrap SHALL report detailed error information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive error handling and recovery, so that the system remains stable under various failure conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Python process crashes THEN the system SHALL detect the failure and log detailed crash information
2. WHEN process creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance
3. WHEN communication is interrupted THEN the system SHALL attempt reconnection with configurable retry policies
4. WHEN resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL gracefully terminate processes and clean up resources
5. WHEN multiple processes are managed THEN the failure of one process SHALL NOT affect others

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configurable process management settings, so that I can tune the system for different use cases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the system THEN users SHALL be able to set process timeout values
2. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN users SHALL be able to configure metrics collection intervals
3. WHEN managing resources THEN users SHALL be able to set memory and CPU limits for Python processes
4. WHEN handling logs THEN users SHALL be able to configure log levels and output destinations
5. WHEN establishing communication THEN users SHALL be able to choose between different IPC mechanisms
